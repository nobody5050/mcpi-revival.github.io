First of all, you will need to get the IP and the port of the server. We host a curated list of good servers [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/servers.html) and in our discord in the #mcpi-servers channel.

## Using Servers.txt
After installing and running reborn atleast once, there will be a folder in your home directory named ~/.minecraft-pi

To add a new server, edit the file located at ~/.minecraft-pi/servers.txt. Each new line is a different server, and the port can optionally be added after the ip like so: `111.111.111.111:12345`. 

After saving the file, you can launch mcpi and press "join game" to see the server in the list, if it's online of course.
